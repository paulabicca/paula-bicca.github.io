## Hey! I’m Paula, nice to meet you :)
My journey in development started in 2017. I’ve always loved writing, especially stories, but it was only in 2024 that I decided to start a blog. The idea came after I wrote a post on LinkedIn that exceeded 5000 characters, and I was forced to shorten it... That’s when I thought, “Why not start a blog?”

I decided I would write about everything I like and find interesting in the tech world. But it won’t always be just about that! Sometimes, I’ll share reflections on what it means to be a woman (and black) in the tech industry.

Besides coding and writing, I also love reading. So, if you have book recommendations (preferably horror, please!), feel free to reach out. :)
