## Hey! I’m Paula, nice to meet you :)
My journey in the world of development began in 2017. I've always loved writing, especially stories, but it wasn't until 2024 that I decided to start a blog. The idea came after I wrote a LinkedIn post that exceeded 5,000 characters, and I had to shorten it... That's when I thought, "Why not start a blog?"

I decided to write about everything I enjoy and find interesting in the world of development. But it won’t be just about development! I’ll also share reflections on what it’s like to be a woman in tech, as well as other topics that make me think or inspire me.
I can promise you’ll find something worth reading here.

Besides coding and writing, I also love reading. So, if you have any book recommendations (especially horror, please!), feel free to reach out. :)
